1. **Background**

	1.1	The Roll20 Marketplace (“Marketplace”) is owned and operated by The Orr Group, LLC, 12109 E. Ayesbury, Wichita, KS, 67226 (“Roll20”). Your use of the Marketplace is governed by a legal agreement between you and Roll20 consisting of the <a href="http://help.roll20.net/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a> which you agreed to upon use of the Roll20 virtual tabletop and the following End User License Agreement (“Roll20-EULA”).
	
	1.2 You may purchase through the Marketplace “Assets” to be used personally and in the Roll20 virtual tabletop. Any Asset that you acquire from the Marketplace that has been developed by Roll20 or that has been made available by third-parties ("Providers") that are not affiliated with Roll20, will be subject to the Roll20-EULA.

	1.3	Further, any free Asset that you acquire from the Marketplace that has been made available by Providers may also be governed by such Provider’s License (such as a Creative Commons License), which you can view prior to using or downloading the free Asset. Any free Asset that the Provider does not furnish a Provider’s License for will be subject to the Roll20-EULA.

	1.4	You may use the Marketplace to browse, locate, and download Assets. Assets are electronic content including, but not limited to, the following forms: computer graphics (including 3D computer graphics), PDF documents, and other digital materials created in order to be utilized while playing games through Roll20. Some of these Assets may be offered by Roll20 while others may be made available by Providers. You agree that Roll20 is not responsible for any Asset on the Marketplace that originates from a source other than Roll20. Additionally, some Assets may be made available to you at no charge while other Assets may be purchased for a fee. You agree that you are solely responsible for all fees associated with purchases you make on the Marketplace.

	1.5	In order to use Marketplace you must be 18 years of age or older. Upon use of Marketplace, you warrant that you have legal capacity to enter into the Roll20-EULA.

2. **Roll20's provision of the Marketplace**
	
	2.1	You agree that Roll20 may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Marketplace (or any features within the Marketplace) to you or to users generally at Roll20’s sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

	2.2	Roll20 may make available to you various payment processing methods to facilitate the purchase of Assets from the Marketplace. You agree to abide by any relevant terms of service or other legal agreement, whether with Roll20 or a third party, that governs your use of a given payment processing method. You agree that Roll20 reserves the right to add or remove payment processing methods at its sole discretion and without notice to you.
 
3. **Your Use of the Marketplace**

	3.4	You agree that you will not engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Marketplace (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Marketplace). You agree that you will not use any of the Assets found on the Marketplace in a way that interferes or disrupts any servers, networks, or websites operated by Roll20 or any third party.
	
	3.5	Unless you have been specifically permitted to do so in a separate agreement with Roll20 and except as permitted under the Roll20-EULA or a Provider License (for free Assets only), you agree that you will not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade or resell any Asset that you have acquired from the Marketplace for any purpose.
	
	3.6	You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Roll20 has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) your use of the Marketplace or any Assets, any breach of your obligations under the Terms, and for the consequences (including loss or damage of any kind which Roll20 may suffer) of any such breach.
	
	3.7	You agree to comply with any and all applicable tax laws, including the reporting and payment of any taxes arising in connection with your use of the Marketplace or the purchase of Assets through the Marketplace, and that the reporting and payment of any such applicable taxes are your responsibility.

	3.8	You agree that Roll20 and/or third parties own all right, title and interest in and to the Marketplace and the Assets available through the Marketplace, including without limitation all applicable Intellectual Property Rights in the Assets.

In addition Roll20 shall itself be entitled to edit and make changes in the Asset. Finally Roll20 shall be entitled to remove the Asset from the Marketplace immediately, or reclassify the Asset at its sole discretion. Roll20 reserves the right to suspend and/or bar any Provider from the Marketplace at its sole discretion.
