title: Roll20 API
---

<div class="alert alert-info">The Roll20 API is currently only available to Mentor subscribers on the Roll20 Dev Server.</div>

The Roll20 API provides a powerful way to customize and enhance your game. It's simple and straightforward to get started, but the possibilities are endless. 

**What do I need to get started?**

Scripts for the Roll20 API are written in Javascript. You only need a basic understanding of the language to get started, but if you want to learn more about Javascript, this [Codecademy course](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript) can help teach you.

**How does it work?**

You write scripts that listen to events that happen during the game. Scripts can check to make sure that rules are followed, change properties on objects and tokens, and even provide custom chat commands. The scripts you write run across the entire campaign, and affect things the GM does as well as all the players.

# API Reference

## Types of Objects

There are several different types of objects that are used throughout the Roll20 API. Here's a quick listing of each, what it is, and what properties it contains (along with the default values).

**Path**

```javascript
{
	fill: "transparent", //fill color. "transparent" or a color HEX
	stroke: "#000000", // stroke color
	rotation: 0, //rotation (in degrees)
	layer: "", //current layer, one of "gmlayer", "objects", "map", "walls" (dynamic lighting)
	stroke_width: 5,
	width: 0,
	height: 0,
	top: 0,
	left: 0,
	scaleX: 1,
	scaleY: 1,
    _type: "path" //can be used to identify the object as a Path. read-only.
}
```

**Text**

```javascript
{
	top: 0,
	left: 0,
	width: 0,
	height: 0,
	text: "",
	font_size: 16, //for best results stick to the pre-sets in the text editing menu
	rotation: 0,
	color: "#000000",
	font_family: "unset", //see values of select element in text editing menu
	layer: "",
    _type: "text" //identifies the object is text. read-only.
}
```
