## 1. Tabletop Toolbox

The toolbox provides you with a series of useful tools for manipulating the table as well as objects on the table such as maps and tokens. Many of these tools are explained in more detail on their own help pages; we've included links to read more about the tool where available.

The **Select/Pan** tool switches between a (default) select mode for manipulating objects and an alternate pan mode for quickly scrolling around the table.

The **Layers** tool (GM Only) switches between the three layers on the tabletop (the Map layer, Objects/Tokens layer, and GM Info layer, which is only visible to the GM). Note that players are always on the Objects/Tokens layer, and cannot switch between layers.

The **Drawing** tools let you draw free-hand as well as shapes on the tabletop that everyone can see. You can also create text.

The **Zoom** tool lets you zoom in or out on the tabletop.

The **Ruler** tool lets you click and drag to measure distances on the table. While you measure, other players will see your measurement line so you can discuss what you're measuring.

The **Fog of War** tool (GM Only) lets you reveal areas of the map gradually so you can hide things you don't want your players to see just yet.

The **Turn Tracker** (GM Only) lets you open up a window to keep track of turn order during encounters. Only the GM can see the button to open the window, but once it's open all players can see the window and the order of the tokens.

The **Dice GUI** is a quick and easy way to roll dice in Roll20, rather than needing to manually type in a formula. It's great for beginning players.

The **Help** tool is a quick way to open a window that shows the Help site (which you're reading right now!), report bugs, and consult the list of keyboard shortcuts.

## 2. The Player Zone

The player zone shows a player avatar and name for each player currently in the game. Each player is also assigned a color (to the right of their name) which they can click to change. The player color is used throughout the interface to represent the actions of that player (such as drawing on the tabletop and rolling dice). You can adjust the size of the avatars that are shown for the players in the My Settings tab of the Sidebar.

Also note that if you use the video/voice chat features of Roll20, the video box for the player will also appear here.

## 3. Player Hands

If the player has any hands (a feature of the Card Decks system), they will appear here.

## 4. Macro Bar

If you enable the Macro Quick Bar in the My Settings tab, a list of your macros will appear here as buttons which you can click to quickly execute the macro.

## 5. The Tabletop

This is the main feature of the Roll20 interface. It's a shared virtual tabletop where the maps and tokens that you are using will appear. Everything that you do on the tabletop (such as moving a token) will be broadcast to everyone else in the game in real-time.

## 6. Page Toolbar

Click this button to open the Page Toolbar, which allows you to manage the pages of your campaign. This is also where you'll go if you want to edit the settings of the current page such as the grid size, grid type, page size, and more.

## 7. Card Decks

If you are using the Card Decks feature, this is where any decks that you have shown will appear, allowing the GM and/or players to draw, play, and deal cards.

## 8. Text Chat

This is where you can communicate with the other players in the game via text chat. Enter your message into the box and press Enter (or click the Send button below the box). There are also advanced commands such as whispers, macros, emotes, and more.

## 9. Sidebar

The Sidebar contains useful tools such as the Text Chat, Art Library (GM Only), Journal, Jukebox, and My Settings. Click the tab to switch between the various tools available.
