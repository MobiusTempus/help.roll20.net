__Settings__

The Settings tab, last to the far right of the sidebar, allows players and GM to control several important functions in Roll20.

First, it allows you to access your [Macros](/macros/) and enable the macro quick bar.

Next, as a GM, it allows you to add and edit [Card Decks](/card-deck).

It also allows you to adjust personal settings, inluding:

*Your out-of-character “real” displayed name.
*Game volume
*[Video and Voice](/video-voice) options

Finally, as a GM, this screen allows you to exit and re-join your game as a player.
