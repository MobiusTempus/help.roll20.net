<div class='alert alert-info'>This feature is only available to paid subscribers-- both Mentor and Supporter levels.  If this is something youâ€™re interested in, please visit the <a href="https://app.roll20.net/account/supporter/">Supporter Page</a>.</div>

# How do I activate Mobile Support?
If you are a subscriber, it should "just work" when you visit the site via tablet.  Do be advised that it is optimized for tablet, not phones, and we have no plans to attempt phone support.

#What are the minimum requirements?

**Apple Devices**
We do all of our testing under the latest version of iOS, so please make sure that your device is up-to-date to ensure the best experience. You must be running at least iOS 5.1 for it work at all, but iOS 6+ is strongly recommended. In addition, Roll20 will not run on the 1st-generation iPad, due to its limited memory. However, iPad 2 and any generation of the Retina iPads, as well as the iPad mini, are all compatible.

**Android Devices**
Chrome for Android (latest version) is the only browser we officially support on the Android platform. We do all of our testing for Android on a Nexus 7. There are too many Android devices available to test them all, but in theory anything with the horsepower of a Nexus 7 or better should work fine. 

Nook devices as well as Kindles (including the Kindle Fire) are not compatible, as they don't have the requisite computer power.

If you have difficulties, please report this to the [Community Help Forums](http://community.roll20.net/categories/help-support).

# Tips for Using Roll20 on Mobile Devices

** Right-click menu **
Since there is no "right-click" on tablets, if you want to bring up the advanced menu for tokens (which you would normally do by right-clicking on a token), just tap and hold on the token for about a second and a half, then release. The advanced menu will pop up and you can proceed.

**Panning vs Selecting**
One finger is used for selecting and manipulating (moving, resizing, etc.) tokens on the tabletop. If you single-tap and hold on a blank area, you will perform a ping. Single-tap and hold on a token to bring up the advanced menu. 

Tap with two or more fingers at once, then drag to pan around the tabletop.

**Remember to hide the keyboard**
Mobile browsers have a tendency to show the keyboard as often as possible, which can make it hard to scroll and move around the screen. Remember that there is often a button on th keyboard which will hide it manually so that you can get your screen real estate back.

**Sound and music limitations**
There is currently a limitation in the Safari Mobile browser which will only allow it to play one sound a time. This means that you can only play one jukebox track at once.

**Video Chat is Unsupported**
Mobile browsers don't currently support Flash or WebRTC, so it is currently not possible to use video chat while you are playing in Roll20. You may use Skype mobile (with your desktop counterparts using Skype for desktop) to have a voice chat going while you are using the mobile browser, though.
