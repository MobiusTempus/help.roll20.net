# How do I activate Mobile Support?
If you are a subscriber, it should "just work" when you visit the site via tablet.  Do be advised that it is optimized for tablets-- not phones, and we have no plans to attempt phone support.

Testing thus far has been done in Mobile Safari on iOS 6 and Chrome for Android.  If you have difficulties, please report this to the [Community Help Forums](http://community.roll20.net/categories/help-support).
