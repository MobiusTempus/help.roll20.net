#How To Find Games
## Automated Search
Access the search by clicking the **Find a Game to Join** link at the top of the Roll20 homepage, or by click [this link](http://app.roll20.net/lfg/search). Here you can enter more information about the kind of game you are looking for. You can search games by keywords like the game system you'd like to play or the genre you are intersted in. If you have a strict schedule use the check boxes to find games that cater to the hours you are available. You can also denote if you are a looking for a game that allows new players so you can learn or mentor. Once you have your information entered hit the **Find Games** button to search.

When you find a game you would be interested in joining click its' title, or the **read more** link in the description. This should take you to the campaign homepage which contains additional details and a list of the current players. If this game seems to be the right fit for you hit the **Apply to Join Game** button and wait for word from the game master.

##Community Forum
If you would like to take a more hands on approach to finding a group the **Roll20 Community Forums** located [here](http://community.roll20.net/categories/looking-for-group). Start by browsing the listings and clicking on the title of a post to get more information. Many threads will list the system being played, the time of the game, if new players are welcome, the number of players still required, or any other pertinent information. The major advantage of the forums is your ability to communicate with the game master before applying to the game, this will allow you to have a better understanding of if a game is right for you.

##External Sites
Additional resources for finding games include the [Reddit/r/Roll20LFG](http://www.reddit.com/r/roll20lfg) as well as various RPG related forums.
