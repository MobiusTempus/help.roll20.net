Roll20 accepts the following image file types: JPGs, PNGs, GIFs

PNG and GIF files with transparent elements will display correctly in Roll20. Animated GIFs **WILL NOT** animate on The Tabletop. It will only display the first frame of animation if an animated GIF is uploaded to Roll20.

##Image Insertion Methods
There are two ways to place images on to The Tabletop: direct upload or an image search.

###Direct Upload
To use images from your own personal files, click on an image from your computer files and drag it directly onto The Tabletop. This will initiate an upload of that image to **Your Art Library**. When the upload is complete, it'll display the image on The Tabletop.

If you would prefer to batch upload a series of images at once, you can do this from the **Your Art Library** window that you can access from the **Art Library** tab of the **Sidebar**. There is a 10 files/5 MB file size per batch limitation to batch uploads.

###Art Search

This method is accomplished by going to the **Art Library** tab in the **Sidebar** and running a search for a desired art element. When you find an image that you wish to use, click the thumbnail from the search and drag it onto The Tabletop.
