##Enabling and Disabling Video & Voice Chat

Go to the My Settings tab (the gear icon) at the top right of Roll20. Scroll down to the bottom of the tab to find **Video + Voice**. There will be three related drop-down menus underneath. They are:

I want to Broadcast to others:

I want to Receive from others:

Video/Player Avatar Size:

The Broadcasting and Receiving drop-down menus have three selection choices: "Video and Voice", "Voice Only", and "Nothing (Disable)." The third drop-down affects how the players appear on the bottom of your screen. You can choose between: Large, Regular, Small, and Names Only. If video is disabled or a player is unable to broadcast video, the player's avatar picture is displayed instead of a video feed.

##Managing Volume

While video/voice is enabled in Roll20, hover your mouse on the bottom right corner of a player's portrait. This action will pop up a volume slider that you can fine tune a player's mic volume to be heard properly. It's important to note that a slider exists on your own portrait and tuning your personal mic volume affects how other players in Roll20 hear you.

##Switching Devices

To switch between multiple microphone and webcam devices, once again hover your mouse on the bottom right corner of a player's portrait. Next to the volume slider that pops up is a wrench button. Clicking on this button brings up a new window where you can specify which devices you wish to use for chat.

##Managing Chat in Google Hangouts

At the top right of Google Hangouts there are four buttons. From left to right they are:

(microphone icon) **Mute microphone** | (camera icon) **Turn camera off** | (gear icon) **Settings** | **Exit**

The first two buttons allow you to disable either your audio or video feed. The Settings button allows you to designate which microphone, webcam, and speaker device you would like to use.
