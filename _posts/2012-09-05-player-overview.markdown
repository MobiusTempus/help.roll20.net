## Transcript

Welcome to Roll20! We’re very excited that you’re here. Since this is the first time you’ve joined a game, here’s a quick overview video to get your started.

You’re looking at the main Roll20 interface. You’re currently logged in as a player. In the middle is the core piece of the interface, the virtual tabletop. It probably looks different than the one in this video, since your GM has customized it. But the things we’re going to show you should still work the same.

The first thing you probably want to do if you haven’t already is turn on your video chat by clicking the “Allow” button here. You can also mouse-over the video chat box to change settings like what camera and microphone you’re using. And if you just want to use audio and not video, head over to your Settings tab here to adjust those options.

In addition to video, you can also communicate via text chat over here on the right side of your screen. To say something to everyone, just type your message and press Enter. There’s also full support for whispering to other players or the GM. And you can also emote to add flavor to the conversation.

And if you want to roll dice, you just type /roll followed by a quick formula. For example, to roll a single d20 with a plus five, I just type /roll 1d20+5. Everyone can see the results of the roll. If you want to keep a roll private, do /gmroll; for example, /gmroll 2d8+2. We support a lot more than just basic rolls, so be sure to ask your GM what options are available if your game system uses more advanced roll mechanics.

Let’s talk tokens. You may see one or more tokens on your screen right now. You may be able to select and move them, or maybe not. That’s based on what your GM has set up. If your GM has given you control of a token, you can click and drag to move it on the tabletop. You can also rotate it to turn it around, and you can use the markers tray here to mark yourself, useful for keeping track of status effects. You may also see one or more bubbles up here if there are stats that your GM wants to show you.

Finally, check out your Journal tab. Your GM can choose to create Characters and Handouts here that you can refer to. So be sure to keep an eye out for secret notes or vital pieces of info!

That’s pretty much all there is to playing in Roll20. If you have any questions, your GM can probably help you out. If you’re feeling a little more adventurous, we do have a help site at help.roll20.net with more detailed information on each feature. And from all of us on the Roll20 team, we hope that you have a great game!
