This is the playspace that represents the actual "table" of your game. It's where you can act out RPG combat with minis on a battlemap, deal a hand of cards and throw around some poker chips, move meeples around a gameboard or just display backdrop pictures to set the right mood.

##Elements of The Tabletop

There's two image element types that display on The Tabletop: **Background Images** and **Tokens**. 

Background Images are any graphics that you don't plan to move or interact with while playing your game. This would be images like the game board of a boardgame or the terrain of a battlemap. You will want to keep these images on the [Map & Background Layer](/tabletop-toolbox-layers).

Tokens are any image that you plan to move around the Table. This would include images like RPG minis, board game components (treasure chests, meeples, etc), poker chips, vehicles and etcerta. An image that is to be treated as a Token must be placed on either the [Objects & Tokens or GM Overlay Info Layer](/tabletop-toolbox-layers).

##Moving Around The Tabletop

You can pan around your Page by either using the scroll bars to the right and bottom of the Tabletop OR click and drag with the right mouse button.

You can zoom either by using the Zoom Tool from the [Tabletop Toolbox] (/tabletop-toolbox) OR hold down alt/option while scrolling with the mouse wheel.

##Pinging the Map

If you click and hold down anywhere on the map, radar rings sprout out from the point of your mouse cursor. The GM/Players' current user color is applied to each Ping to better identify who's indicating what. This tool can help indicate points of interests on a map

###Shift+Ping (GM Feature)

A GM can force all their players to view a certain area of the map by holding the Shift key while Pinging. This is very helpful if you have a very large dungeon map to explore. When a new Page is loaded, the Tabletop's view is automatically set to the upper left hand corner of the Page. If you have the Fog of War enabled, your players might be greeted with their entire Tabletop filled with black fog. Instead of the players panning around the Page to locate their tokens, a Shift Ping leads your players right where they need to be.
