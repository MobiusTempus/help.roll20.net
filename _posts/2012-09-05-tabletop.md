This is the playspace that represents the actual "table" of your game. It's where you can act out RPG combat with minis on a battlemap, deal a hand of cards and throw around some poker chips, move meeples around a gameboard or just display backdrop pictures to set the right mood.

##Moving Around The Tabletop

You can pan around your Page by either using the scroll bars to the right and bottom of the Tabletop OR hold down alt/option while click and dragging with the right mouse button.

You can zoom either by using the Zoom Tool from the [Tabletop Toolbox] (/tabletop-toolbox) OR hold down alt/option while scrolling with the mouse wheel.

##Pinging the Map

If you click and hold down anywhere on the map, radar rings sprout out from the point of your mouse cursor. The GM/Players' current user color is applied to each Ping to better identify who's indicating what. This tool can help indicate points of interests on a map
