## Finding Music

  Go to the Jukebox tab at the top right of Roll20.  This accesses the sounds and music library, which utilizes [SoundCloud](http://www.soundcloud.com/ "SoundCloud").  Click the **Add+** button, which will bring up a search menu.  From there, use the dropdown menu to select if you're looking for background music, sound effects, or to search all of Soundcloud. Enter keywords in the search box to look for sounds.  You can Preview the songs by pressing the **Play** button or add them to your current session library with the **+** button.  

## Playing/broadcasting music

  Any music or sounds you've added to your campaign can be played by simply pressing the play button.  It will be audible to all players in the session.  Note that you can play more than one file at a time, and all files automatically loop until paused.  Each track has its own volume control which can be used to normalize their volume. To rename a track just click on the title and enter a custom one. 

## Master volume control

  In addition to the Game Master's control of individual track volume in the Jukebox tab, each person connected to the game can also use the Master Volume Control located under the Settings tab to control the volume level of all music being played.
  
## Looping Music

  Each track has a check box for optionally looping the tune.  Before the music is played, uncheck this box to have the music only play once-- otherwise the track will loop as persistant background music until you pause it.
  
## Renaming Tracks

  To rename a track, simple click on its title in the Jukebox tab of the Sidebar (after you've added it to the Jukebox playlist). Type a new name and press Return to save.
