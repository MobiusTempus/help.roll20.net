__Journal__

The Roll20 journal, found under the third tab of the right hand sidebar, is a place to store in game worldbuilding information.

##Characters
To start a new character, click the "+Add" button under the character portion.  The system randomly generates a placeholder name and creates the character.  From this point, "Edit" the character to add images, text, and change who controls the character.  You can allow players to see the data based on selections here, as well as DELETE or ARCHIVE the character.

##Handouts
Handouts are controlled very similarly to characters. Under the handout option, click the "+Add" button to start a new handout, which will begin with the default name "Mysterious Note."  From this point, "Edit" the handout to add images, texts, and control who can see the handout.  You can DELETE or ARCHIVE the handout from this screen as well.
