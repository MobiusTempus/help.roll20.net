//I think "The Tabletop" might be a better title than "Maps"

## The Interface
(Picture of a numbered view of Roll20)

1. The Tabletop: This is where you play cards, move meeples around a gameboard, act out battles with minis on a battlemap or just display setting backdrops to set the right mood.
2. Page Toolbar: This is where you create, navigate and 
3. Table Toolbar
4. The Sidebar
5. Player Row
6. Macro Row

##Table Toolbar
(Insert Picture of toolbar here)

The Select & Pan Tool: There are two tools under this option: **Select/Move** and **Pan View**. The **Select/Move** tool is for selecting any graphic/drawing/token/text element that is on the page space. The **Pan Tool** pans your view of the map around at your current zoom.

Layers: This allows you to switch between the three layers **Map & Background**, **Objects & Tokens** and **GM Info Overlay**. This is covered in depth below.

Drawing Tools: This is a collection of brush, shapes and text tools which allows the players and the GM to draw on The Tabletop on the fly. Go [here] (drawing tools help link) for an indepth description of Roll20's drawing tools.

Zoom: This brings up a drop down of different zoom percentages for the tabletop. It ranges from 10% to 150%.

Ruler: When the **Ruler Tool** is selected clicking and dragging on the map will measure distance. Units of measurement for any given page are defined in the [Page Settings](page settings help page).

Fog of War: There are two Fog of War tools under this option: **Reveal Areas** and **Hide Areas**. If the Fog of War is enabled in the [Page Settings](page settings help page), click and drag to trace rectangles on the tabletop to either hide from or reveal areas to the players.

Turn Order: Clicking on this brings up the Turn Order window. This is covered in depth below.

Help: This Tool supplies direct links to these help documents and to the bug report forum. It also pops open a window for Roll20's keyboard shortcuts.

##Uploading Graphics to Roll20
There are two methods for uploading images in Roll20. The first is to click and drag any single GIF, JPG or PNG from your computer and drop it anywhere on the Tabletop. This graphic will be added automatically to your personal art library. Once a graphic is added to this library, it's available for use for any of your existing or future campaigns.

If you'd like to upload a batch of images at once to Roll20, you can do it directly within the **Your Art Library** window. To access this window, go to the Sidepanel and click on the **Art Library** tab. Once you're on that tab, click on the **Your Art Library** Star Icon located near the top of the tab. The **Your Art Library** window is where every single piece of art you've uploaded for every campaign is located. Here you can edit tags for your graphics to make it easier to pull up in the general art search from the Sidebar. You can also browse through the graphics you bought on Roll20's Marketplace here too by clicking on the **Your Purchases** link in the upper right of the window. Clicking on the **Upload** link will display a box where you can drop up to ten graphic files into or you can select specific files by clicking on the **Choose a file...** button to bring up a file directory window. Note: Every batch upload has a 5 MB total file size maximum.

OLD STUFF


  Be certain that you are on the background / map layer (accessed via the left side toolbar).  You can use the Art Library to quickly find maps to use in your campaign, by searching under the "maps" section in the drop down menu. There are some built-in assets, and if you scroll down further you’ll see that it’s also searching popular RPG forums and sites on the web.  After finding the appropriate map, you may simply drag and drop it into the table area.  Additionally, you can drag and drop images directly from your computer to the Roll20 interface to be used as maps.


## Using map tiles

  You can make you own environments using tiles.  Search for keywords such as "grass", "stone", "rock", and even "wall" via the Art Library, and then drag and drop the relevant tiles so you can arrange them in the table area.  To create several of the same map tile in a row, click and drag on the orange handle that appears when you select the tile on the tabletop. You can also use Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V to copy and paste tiles.


## Grids

  At the top of the screen you can access the "Page Toolbar" menu.  Each individual page of your campaign is listed in the area.  Mousing over each page allows you to click on the settings icon to access its settings menu, which allows you to indicate whether the page will have a square grid, hex grid, or be gridless.


## Adjusting the Map

  Be advised that you can move and scale objects independent of the grid by pressing 'alt' as you resize.
  

## Using Fog-of-War

  To use Fog-of-War elements (blacking out portions of the screen for players) go to the top "Page Toolbar" area, and click on the individual page you want to have Fog-of-War (this is on the same page as Grid options).  There you can this feature on or off.  Once it is on, you can use the left toolbar to add or subtract visibility for your players.
  

## Pinging the Map

  Game Masters AND players can easily ping the map by left mouse clicking and holding.  A small circular ping should appear.
