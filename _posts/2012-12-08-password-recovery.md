#Password Recovery

To recover a lost or forgotten password start by clicking on the **Virtual Tabletop** button in the top left hand corner of the Roll20 homepage, this should navigate you to a login page. Click the link labeled **I canâ€™t remember my password >>** located just below the password field. Next, enter the email address you used to register for the site and click the **Recover My Password** button. You may also access the account recovery page by [clicking here](app.roll20.net/account/lost_password).

Once the email arrives, click the link inside of it to navigate to your account info page. By scrolling to the bottom of the page you can enter and confirm a new password. Click **Save Changes** and the process is complete.
