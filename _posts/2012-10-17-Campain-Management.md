#Campaign Creation
While on the **My Campaigns** page, click on the button **+ Start a New Campaign** to create a new campaign. This will bring up a new page where you’ll be able to assign a Title and keyword Tags (these keywords are how players will find your game via the Looking for Group tool). Click the **I’m Ready, Create Campaign!** button to add the new campaign to your list.
#The Campaign Details Page
Clicking on either the campaign’s name, icon, or “View Details” link will bring up the campaign’s Details Page. This is where most of the campaign’s management features are located.
##Campaign Icon
This image serves as the icon that represents your campaign. It’s visible from the campaign list, the details page and when your campaign is listed in the Looking for Group index. To add an icon, you can drag an image from your desktop to the indicated image box or click the **Choose a File** button to select one from your files folders. To remove or replace an image, hover your mouse over the current icon image and a **Remove** button will appear on the upper right hand corner of the image. Click the button to remove the image.
##Campaign Information
The **Playing** text field is a good place to indicate what system/game you’re playing or to designate a specific module/adventure pack being run. The **Next game will be** field is where you would let your players know when the next session is. *Note: It helps to be very specific about your time zone if you plan to play with gamers who might live across the globe* The **Description** field is where you can post instructions for first time players, flavor text for your campaign or anything else that would be helpful.
##Kicking Players and GM Promotion
Underneath the campaign description is a list of every player who has ever joined the current campaign. When you hover over any player icon you’ll get the options **Kick Player** or **Promote to GM**. Kick Player will remove the player from your campaign. Promote to GM will elevate a player’s permissions to GM status. This decision should be made with care as this promoted player will have access to all features that you, as the original GM, are privy too. Promoting a GM is useful for instances such as, but not limited to: GM co-op, requiring a second pair of hands to set up an impromptu encounter on the Tabletop or when playing a board game where you don’t need a permission lock on components.
*Tip: If a player’s avatar image uses unorthodox dimensions, it might make it difficult to access the Kick/Promote options. If this happens, right click while your mouse hovers over the avatar image. This will bring up the browser’s right click menu. While this menu is open you should then be able to access the Kick/Promote options*
##Campaign Discussion
This is a message board that you and the players of the current campaign can use to pass information back and forth when not currently in a session.
