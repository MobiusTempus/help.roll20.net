A rollable table is a way to make a randomized object, which is very useful when making custom dice for specifc games.

* __Starting a Rollable Table__

Rollable tables are found under the right-hand Sidebar, under the "Decks and Tables" tab.  To start a table, click "Add" and the interface will show you have a "new-table" with a # "0" sides.  
 
* __Editing your Rollable Table__

Click on the name of the table, which again by default was "new-table".  This will launch a pop-up screen, from which you can change the name of the table, toggle whether or not players can use this table, and add the "sides" to your table.

To add a side, click "Add item" which will launch an additional pop-up screen.  Similar to the last you can then name this item.  You can use the item by name only, as the name will be presented in the chat window when rolled.

If you would like to use an image, you can simply drag and drop that image or click the "Choose a File" button.

* __Using your Rollable Table__

From the "Decks & Tables" tab of the Sidebar, you can simply click the "Roll" button to use  your table, and the system will randomly select onr of your "items" to show as the roll result.  After rolling it once, it also shows up as one of your last ten rolls in the Dice Roller.

If your table has images, it can also be used as a token.  To do so, click the "Token" button from the "Dice & Tables" tab.  Each click will generate a token on the table.  Right clicking on that token you will see an option for "Multi-Sided."  From here you can either select "Random Side" to generate a roll of this token OR select "Choose Side" to have this token show a specific image on the board.

Please note that changes to the rollable table are NOT reflected in a token already in the gameplay area.  If you edit a rollable table and want those edits to be shown in your tokens, you will need to generate a new token.
