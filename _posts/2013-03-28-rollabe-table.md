A rollable table is a collection of items from which a single item will be randomly chosen. It can be used to create custom dice, critical success/failure tables, loot tables, or any other list of items that need to "rolled."

* __Starting a Rollable Table__

Rollable tables are found under the right-hand Sidebar, under the "Decks and Tables" tab.  To start a table, click "Add" and the interface will show you have a "new-table" with "0" items.  
 
* __Editing your Rollable Table__

Click on the name of the table, which again by default was "new-table".  This will launch a pop-up screen, from which you can change the name of the table, toggle whether or not players can use this table, and add "items" to your table.

To add an item, click "Add Item," which will launch an additional pop-up screen.  Similar to the last you can then name this item.  By default, the name you enter will be shown in the chat box if this item is selected when the table is rolled.

If you are creating custom dice which have numeric values, enter a number into the name field. Otherwise you can enter any text you want.

If your rollable table has icons representing each item, or you are creating custom dice which have graphical sides, you can drag and drop an image into the Icon area. The icon you upload will be shown in the chat box if the item is selected during a roll.

* __Using your Rollable Table__

From the "Decks & Tables" tab of the Sidebar, you can simply click the "Roll" button to use  your table, and the system will randomly select one of your "items" to show as the roll result.  After rolling it once, it also shows up as one of your last ten rolls in the Dice Roller.

You can also roll a table directly in the chat input, or in a macro, by using the special roll command `1t[table-name]`. For example, to roll your "crit-failure" table one time, you would enter `/roll 1t[crit-failure]`. You can change `1` to whatever number you would like.

If you have assigned icons to the items in your table, the table can also be used as a token.  To do so, click the "Token" button in the list of rollable tables.  Each click will generate a token on the table.  Right clicking on that token you will see an option for "Multi-Sided."  From here you can either select "Random Side" to generate a roll of this token OR select "Choose Side" to have this token show a specific image on the board.

Please note that changes to the rollable table are NOT reflected in a token already in the gameplay area.  If you edit a rollable table and want those edits to be shown in your tokens, you will need to generate a new token.
