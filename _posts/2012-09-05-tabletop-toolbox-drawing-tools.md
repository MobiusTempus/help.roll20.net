Roll20 features a powerful set of drawing tools that you can use to do lots of things, like making notes on the tabletop or even quickly sketching out an entire map. 

The drawing tools are all located here in the drawing tools button of the toolbar. The most common tool is the Brush tool. Just click and drag to draw!

You can change the stroke color (1.) as well as the fill color (2.) and line width (3.) of your drawing by using the secondary toolbar here. If you want to draw straight lines, just hold down the **Shift key**. Holding down the **Alt key** will let you draw circles easily.

There’s also a text tool that lets you write directly on the tabletop. Just choose the text tool from the toolbar, and then click on the tabletop where you want to type. You can change the font (1.), size (2.), and color (3.) of the text using the secondary toolbar here.

When you want to move or resize your drawings, use the Draw Select tool. Notice that you can’t select any tokens with that tool. That’s to help keep things separated on your table, since you usually don’t want to move tokens when you’re moving your drawings. If you do want to move images around, you can right-click on a token and select “Is Drawing” from the Advanced menu. From then on, the token will be treated like other drawings, and it won’t have a radial menu or any token settings like bars.

You can also group things together by selecting them and choosing “Group” from the Advanced Menu. Grouping things lets you keep them in sync so you always move them at the same time. 

Finally, you can choose to clear all of the drawings on the current layer by using the Clear button in the toolbar. It’s a great way to quickly delete any sketches that have been made during a battle, for example.
