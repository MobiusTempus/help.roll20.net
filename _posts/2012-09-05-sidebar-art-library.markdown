__Art Library__

The art library allows Game Masters to search Roll20 for images.

Under the second tab of the sidebar you can search for tokens, maps, and other items.

##Favorites

If you've just searched items, you can favorite what comes up in the search by selecting the star image next to the item.

##Account Art Library

If you select the general star icon in your art library, you access your personal Art Library, your Marketplace purchases, and an area to keep track of your art Uploads.  Within your personal library, you can tag items to easier find them. 

##Deleting content for data usage

Roll20 allows 100MBs worth of art assets to be used by a free account.  To free up space, you can simply delete items in your library by selecting the red trash can icon next to the image.  The system will prompt you prior to deleting the data to confirm that you wish to continue.
