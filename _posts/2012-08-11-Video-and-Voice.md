Video/Player Avatar Size:

The Broadcasting and Receiving drop-down menus have three selection choices: "Video and Voice", "Voice Only", and "Nothing (Disable)." The third drop-down affects how the players appear on the bottom of your screen. You can choose between: Large, Regular, Small, and Names Only. If video is disabled or a player is unable to broadcast video, the player's avatar picture is displayed instead of a video feed.
